## Overview
TILO is a collection of Turing machine implementations designed to demonstrate various computational capabilities, including single-tape and multi-tape machines. These machines simulate fundamental computational processes and are built to handle binary operations. Below are the key projects within TILO.

## Projects

### 1. **Turing Machine for Addition**
   This project implements a single-tape Turing machine that performs binary addition of two numbers.

   **Key Features:**
   - The machine operates on a binary string that includes two numbers separated by a `+` symbol.
   - The Turing machine processes the binary input and outputs the sum of the two binary numbers.
   - Designed to follow the traditional rules of a Turing machine, including reading, writing, and moving along the tape.

   **Example:**
   - Input: `101 + 11`
   - Output: `1000` (5 + 3 = 8 in binary)

### 2. **Multiple Tape Turing Machine**
   This project demonstrates a more complex, multitape Turing machine, which can operate simultaneously on multiple tapes to increase efficiency for specific tasks.

   **Key Features:**
   - Multiple tapes allow for parallel processing, reducing the number of steps required for complex computations.
   - Each tape operates independently, but they interact through the machine’s control mechanism.
   - This implementation can be extended to handle more sophisticated tasks than a single-tape machine.

   **Use Cases:**
   - Suitable for more complex algorithms that require the division of tasks across tapes.
   - Can be applied to more advanced operations such as multiplication or language recognition problems in computational theory.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have a Turing machine simulator or environment set up.
3. Input your binary numbers and run the machine according to the project’s specifications.
